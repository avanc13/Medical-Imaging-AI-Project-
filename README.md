## Rapid tissue parameter mapping via random FLASH synthesis
This project aims to estimate the quantitative tissue parameters (T2* and T1​ρ) from multi-echo FLASH MRI images using a deep learning model. We aim to train and evaluate several neural network architectures in supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised settings. 

1. The `models` folder contains model implementations. As of now, we have Network 1 and the least squares implemented.
2. The `scripts` folder contains scripts for preprocessing and checking the raw data.
3. The `dataloader` folder contains the code to load the data following the file structure of the training data.
4. The `train` folder has
